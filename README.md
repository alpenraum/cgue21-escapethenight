## Genre
Horror, Room Escape
## Goal
You start in a dark forest and have to find the way back home before you go insane




## Story
Mama always told you not to go out by night, but you did not listen. Now there is a Serial Killer after you. Your goal is to find home, preferably without dying.
## Gameplay
It is dark and the only light source is your torch and some campfires left by hikers. In Darkness you will lose your sanity which will eventually run out and you lose the game. The torch slows this process and campfires restore it, but the killer will find you easier. The goal is at a random location each time.
